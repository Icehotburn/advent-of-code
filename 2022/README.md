My Javascript solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). The structure for the project was heavily inspired by [zsoltime/advent-of-code](https://github.com/zsoltime/advent-of-code).

## Usage

To find the solution for a given day:

1. copy your input into the desired day's input.txt file
2. run `npm run solve <day>` i.e `npm run solve day-01`

To test the solution for a given day:

1. run `npm test -- {pathToTestFile}` i.e `npm test -- ./day-01/index.test.ts`

## Layout

- README.md: the problem
- input.txt: the provided input
- index.js: my solution
- index.test.js: test for index.js using the provided example
